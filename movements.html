            Ordinary folks can become citizen journalists in their own right, they can create their own stories or rebroadcast news stories.  
            This works on a global scale so it’s easy to see why some might say it could be considered a mainstream event.  
            But movements can start small, a simple hashtag or simple social media post can become a global phenomenon.  
            Let’s take a look at a few of examples of global movements that were started online.

          <h2>Black Lives Matter</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">Black Lives Matter started in 2013, starting as a social media post using #BlackLivesMatter after George Zimmerman was acquitted for killing Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager.  The movement protests police brutality and racially motivated crimes against Black people.  They gained more traction when they organized protests during the 2016 election and expanded the movement to a national network.  Even more recently, in 2020, Black Lives Matter became one of the largest movements in the U.S. when people came out en masse to protest the killing of George Floyd, along with several other innocent Black people, at the hands of police.  Black Lives Matter has also experienced a globalization of their cause with Black Lives Matter Global. This movement, thanks to sharing and using the hashtag, has seen protests gathering in the UK, Canada, parts of Asia, and Europe.</p>

          <h2>Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women </h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">The missing and murdered Indigenous women can be considered an epidemic on its own, it affects the First Nations, Inuit, and Native American communities across the U.S. and Canada.  Native American women are sexually assaulted and murdered at a rate that is 10 times higher on average (Smith-Morris 2020), these crimes also usually see little to no justice.  The organizers of this movement addresses this shocking statistic by using #MMIW to bring more attention to the cause.  Since the movement started they have been organizing marches and vigils through the use of digital media and have seen a move toward better legislative responses to change some of the protection laws that have failed over the years.

          <h2>Occupy Wall Street</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">Occupy Wall street is an antiglobalization movement that started in 2011 in New York as a response to economic inequality.  The creators used an email list to help start the idea and organize the occupation (Komlik 2014).  After the idea was launched, a website was created and the group started using Facebook and Twitter to promote the demonstrations.  This movement inspired other protests around the globe, motivating others to speak out against social and economic inequality.  The Occupy protests are often criticized for not having any clear agenda, but the movement is more about the expression of frustration of the system and calling out the failures of international institutions and globalization.  </p>

          <h2>What Does the Future Hold?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">Digital activism is a powerful means of social and political mobilization and provides a new way to engage protesters, it simultaneously allows for decentralized mass communication that can easily sway public opinion and a centralized group communication to allow for planning and organizing.  And research says that users have changed their views on issues because of sharing on social media.  (Perrin 2020) Digital activism can take on many forms.  But the use of digital technology has been proven to make a big difference in the way that we mobilize social and political movements.

          <h2>A Final Thought</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">We are in a time where we are increasingly at home and online, and as some have observed, “digitally mediated collective action formations have frequently been larger; have scaled up more quickly; and have been flexible in tracking moving political targets and bridging different issues” (Bennet and Segerberg 2012, 4).  We have seen through examples like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street that participation in collective action is much larger when the message can be spread through popular forms of digital media.
