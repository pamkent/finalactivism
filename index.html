            Social and political movements are adapting to the changing needs of our society, we are increasingly online and so are the methods of activism.  Globalization and technology now allow social and political movements to cross borders as quickly as we can come up with the idea.

          <h2>Digital Activism</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">  
       Digital activism has become more commonplace, with email lists, web pages, and social media we have become accustomed to a wide spread of messages asking for support or signatures for a cause.  
            Recently, when we are faced with the global pandemic COVID-19, we have had to change the way we educate our children, communicate with loved ones, and our reliance on the Internet for news and shopping has accelerated.  
            While digital activism is not a new phenomenon, activists are now relying more on the forms of digital media to get their message out and reach a global audience.  
            Digital activism, as with other kinds of activism, is necessary when conventional methods of addressing injustice to bring about change fail; an online campaign can spread to a lot more people than relying on slower methods like the mail.  
            Activism is about getting people together and getting the message to as many people as possible, sharing and raising awareness is one of the most important aspects of activism, the use of online tools makes spreading your message to a wider audience even easier.  </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-white showcase-img" style="background-image: url('img/hashtags.png');background-size:750px;background-repeat:no-repeat;"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 my-auto showcase-text">
          <h2>Mainstream and Mundane?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">Some critics of digital activism argue that some methods have become “mainstream and mundane” (Morozov 2020) using the same tools and techniques that have started revolutionary movements for even the most trivial of causes.  
            I am here to argue that even though there is perhaps an overwhelming amount of online campaigns, digital activism is still being used as an effective tool for organizing social and political movements and is being used to connect and inspire people globally.  
            Because the methods of digital activism often go along with, or call for, in-person activism, movements that have relied on the visibility and effectiveness of street protests have had to become more creative in how they organize. 
            It is becoming more important for digital activists to strategically navigate the digital landscape.  
            The research done here is important for understanding that digital activism works on a global scale and provides a new way to engage with this wider audience, whether that is gaining signatures or calling for organized action, activists are using digital tools to their advantage.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 order-lg-1 my-auto showcase-text">
          <h2>Is it all on Facebook?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">Not necessarily, digital activism is not just contained to a Facebook or Twitter campaign, these are certainly strong places to start but there are also email lists, e-petitions and webpages.  
            While social media has redefined social and political activism, people around the globe are becoming increasingly interested in using other modes of media in the fight for change.  Email campaigns, text messaging, virtual sit-ins, webpages, and online petitions are being used alongside social media to increase participation in social and political protest.  
            As some have pointed out, “there were no clear associations between particular tools and specific campaign outcomes. Even the most technology- intensive social movement should never be called a Twitter or Facebook revolution.” (Edwards et al. 2013, 14)

          <h2>Why is this so important to know?</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">Because there are new technologies that help us all better communicate and get the message out there faster.  As scholars have pointed out, “the horizontal networking logic facilitated by new digital technologies not only provides an effective method of social movement organizing, it also represents a broader model for creating alternative forms of social, political, and economic organization.” (Juris 2005, 191)  These new technologies are allowing organizers to flex their creativity and appeal to a wider audience.
